## Image Manipulation
Image manipulation program implemented using x86 assembly language, Irvine32 link library, OpenGL, and rendering-related function by Sai-Keung WONG.

## Features
Show student ID using bitmaps

Blend two images based on transparency

Convert an image to a gray level image

Toggle blue mode - Increase/decrease intensity of blue color component continuously

Show a grid which is superimposed with the image

Change the grid dimension

Use the mouse to select and copy regions of an image

Reset the image

## How to Run
Project files, including .sln file, should be put in `D:\4T\desktop\x86 asm final project rebuild(failed)\`, because library-related settings are absolute paths.

Cannot build. Possible cause of failure:
> Cannot use old OpenGL library because [backward binary compatibility issue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/overview-of-potential-upgrade-issues-visual-cpp?view=vs-2019) in Visual C++ and `legacy_stdio_definitions.lib` doesn't solve the problem.
